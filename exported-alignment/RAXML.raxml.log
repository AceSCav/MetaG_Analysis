RAxML-NG was called at 10-Jun-2025 21:51:47 as follows:

raxml-ng --bootstrap --msa aligned-dna-sequences_withTaxonomy.fasta --model JC+G4 --prefix RAXML --seed 2 --threads 5

Analysis options:
  run mode: Bootstrapping
  start tree(s): 
  bootstrap replicates: parsimony (max: 1000) + bootstopping (autoMRE, cutoff: 0.030000)
  random seed: 2
  tip-inner: OFF
  pattern compression: ON
  per-rate scalers: OFF
  site repeats: ON
  logLH epsilon: general: 0.100000, brlen-triplet: 1000.000000
  fast spr radius: AUTO
  spr subtree cutoff: 1.000000

[00:00:00] Reading alignment from file: aligned-dna-sequences_withTaxonomy.fasta
[00:00:00] Loaded alignment with 2496 taxa and 1842 sites

Alignment comprises 1 partitions and 1603 patterns

Partition 0: noname
Model: JC+G4m
Alignment sites / patterns: 1842 / 1603
Gaps: 85.39 %
Invariant sites: 21.44 %


NOTE: Binary MSA file already exists: RAXML.raxml.rba

Parallelization scheme autoconfig: 5 worker(s) x 1 thread(s)


NOTE: Per-rate scalers were automatically enabled to prevent numerical issues on taxa-rich alignments.
NOTE: You can use --force switch to skip this check and fall back to per-site scalers.

WARNING: The model you specified on the command line (JC+G4) will be ignored 
         since the binary MSA file already contains a model definition.
         If you want to change the model, please re-run RAxML-NG 
         with the original PHYLIP/FASTA alignment and --redo option.
